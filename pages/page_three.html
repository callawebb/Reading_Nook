        <h1>My Favorites</h1>
        <p> My favorite bookstores spread far and wide. When I travel I love to sort through a bookstore to get a sense of their culture and community. Picking a bookstore aligned with your interests is important because each bookstroe markets themselves differently and carries a different voice. </p>
            <p>My List:
            Magers and Quin- A Minneapolis staple I have been frequenting for years. 
            Birchbark Books- Owned by National Book Award Winner Louise Erdrich. Carries a strong voices for women, nature, and the marginalized.
            Barnes and Noble- Sometimes you just want to know what everyone is reading. 
            Black Garnet Books- The only black owned bookstore in the Twin Cities provides a platform for many voices.
            Wild Rumpus- Nestled into Linden Hills, this bookstore brings the charm and a plethora of nearby reading nooks
            Thriftbooks.com-you don't have to spend an arm and a leg to induldge in knowledge. They are always reliable and have a great selection.
            Libraries- A gift that keeps on giving. I'm always thankfully surprised with their contemporary selections, as well. 
            </p>
        <h2>A thought.....</h2>
        <p> Finding your favorite bookstore is personal and is a journey. I hope you find the one that suits your reading desires and helps you find community.</p>
